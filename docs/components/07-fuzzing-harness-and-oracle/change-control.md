# Fuzzing Harness and Oracle — Change Control Log

Component code: **FUZZ**. Entry format and required fields: see `../README.md`.
Newest first.

### CC-FUZZ-0001 — Baseline (2026-09-21)
- Change: record the component at its current state — `blind_sqli_fuzzer.py`
  performs time-based blind SQLi detection (median of repeats), requires `--url`
  and `--authorized`, and emits a labeled CSV. Detection is decoupled from the
  payload label. The generalized harness and the standalone deterministic oracle
  are specified but not yet built.
- Impact (other components / project): the oracle is the only writer of `finding`
  labels, so it is the trust anchor for the scheduler's reward, the classifier's
  training data, and all reports (D10). Generalizing the harness lets one engine
  serve multiple vulnerability classes; until then only blind SQLi is covered.
- Risk (level; mitigation): high — a wrong oracle silently corrupts every label
  and every learned model downstream. Mitigated by: differential (not absolute)
  timing, median-of-repeats, decoupling detection from the payload label (removes
  the earlier circular-labeling bug), grey-box confirmation when available,
  measured oracle precision, and state reset between iterations. Safety mitigated
  by the required `--authorized` flag, default-off destructive classes, and
  auth-endpoint exclusion.
- Deliverables:
  - [x] Time-based blind SQLi detection, median of repeats — done.
  - [x] `--authorized` gate; missing-`requests` import guard — done.
  - [x] Detection decoupled from payload label (circular-labeling fix) — done.
  - [x] Labeled CSV output — done.
  - [ ] Generalize to `template + injection_point + payload_source + oracle` — todo (Phase 2).
  - [ ] Standalone deterministic oracle (differential timing + error signatures) — todo (Phase 2).
  - [ ] Grey-box coverage / DB-fault confirmation — todo (Phase 3).
  - [ ] Write `attempt`/`finding` to the shared store — todo (Phase 0 T0.8).
- Effectiveness (assessed or pending): effective for time-based blind SQLi on the
  lab (confirms known points; circular-labeling defect removed). Multi-class
  harness, standalone oracle, and grey-box confirmation pending.
