# Fuzzing Harness and Oracle — Change Control Log

Component code: **FUZZ**. Entry format and required fields: see `../README.md`.
Newest first.

### CC-FUZZ-0004 — Fuzzer HTTP migrated onto the auth seam (2026-09-21)
- Change: the fuzzer's HTTP now goes through a sender abstraction — `RequestsSender`
  (standalone, unchanged raw-requests behavior) or `SeamSender` (routes through the
  `core/` HTTP seam with the session manager, timing-serialized per host). Added a
  `--identity` flag: with it, the fuzzer authenticates as that identity (per-host
  credentials, detection-only login) via a shared `fuzzlab/tools/authhttp.py`
  helper; without it, behavior is exactly as before. Realizes the requests-tool
  half of Phase 1 T1.10 for the fuzzer.
- Impact (other components / project): the fuzzer can now fuzz authenticated
  endpoints as a given identity; depends on the session manager (#3) and credential
  store. Timing goes through the seam's per-host mutex. No output-format change.
- Risk (level; mitigation): medium — must not perturb standalone timing. Mitigated
  by keeping `RequestsSender` byte-identical to the old `measure_once`, routing
  timing through the seam only on the authenticated path (`timing=True`), and
  fail-loud auth (a `SessionAuthError` aborts the run rather than fuzzing
  unauthenticated). Covered by 3 tests (URL building, standalone unchanged,
  authenticated send attaches the session cookie).
- Deliverables:
  - [x] Sender abstraction; `--identity`; `authhttp` helper — done.
  - [x] Tests (standalone + authenticated) — done.
  - [ ] Live authenticated fuzz run against the lab (T1.10) — todo (needs a lab).
- Effectiveness (assessed 2026-09-21): effective in tests — the authenticated
  sender attaches the session and reaches the fuzzed URL; standalone path
  unchanged. Live run pending.

### CC-FUZZ-0003 — Writes attempts/findings to the unified store (2026-09-21)
- Change: added `--store PATH` to the fuzzer; after a run it consolidates its CSV
  into the unified store via `store_adapter.import_fuzz_csv`, writing `attempt`
  rows (behavioral features JSON + reward) and, for confirmed timing hits, a
  `finding` row (vuln_class `sqli`, label 1, confidence `timing-only`, self-
  describing url/method/param). Native CSV unchanged without `--store`. Phase 0 T0.8.
- Impact (other components / project): closes the Phase 0 loop — the harness (T0.7)
  reads these findings to score against ground truth. Note the confidence is
  `timing-only`: the deterministic oracle that will own finding labels is Phase 2,
  so these are provisional confirmations flagged as such, not oracle verdicts.
- Risk (level; mitigation): medium — writing findings from a timing-only signal
  risks false positives before the real oracle exists. Mitigated by flagging them
  `timing-only`, keeping the differential/median timing logic from the baseline,
  and requiring `--authorized`; the Phase 2 oracle will supersede this path.
- Deliverables:
  - [x] `--store` + `import_fuzz_csv` (attempt + finding rows) (T0.8) — done.
  - [ ] Replace timing-only findings with the deterministic oracle (Phase 2) — todo.
- Effectiveness (assessed 2026-09-21): effective for Phase 0 — synthetic fuzz
  output yields 3 attempts and 2 timing findings that the harness scores as true
  positives on the lab's known GET SQLi cases (test green).

### CC-FUZZ-0002 — Moved into the `fuzzlab` package (2026-09-21)
- Change: `blind_sqli_fuzzer.py` moved to `fuzzlab/tools/blind_sqli_fuzzer.py`;
  imports `core/` (`get_logger`, structured startup line after the `--authorized`
  gate). Behavior unchanged; still writes a labeled CSV (T0.8 moves it onto the
  store). Phase 0 T0.1.
- Impact (other components / project): the fuzzer is now a package module; the
  `--authorized` safety gate and detection logic are unchanged.
- Risk (level; mitigation): low — move + one import placed after the authorization
  check so the gate still fires first; verified the module imports and `--help` runs.
- Deliverables:
  - [x] Move into package; import `core/` (T0.1) — done.
  - [ ] Read candidates / write attempts+findings to the shared store (T0.8) — todo.
- Effectiveness (assessed 2026-09-21): effective — runs as a package module with
  the authorization gate intact.

### CC-FUZZ-0001 — Baseline (2026-09-21)
- Change: record the component at its current state — `blind_sqli_fuzzer.py`
  performs time-based blind SQLi detection (median of repeats), requires `--url`
  and `--authorized`, and emits a labeled CSV. Detection is decoupled from the
  payload label. The generalized harness and the standalone deterministic oracle
  are specified but not yet built.
- Impact (other components / project): the oracle is the only writer of `finding`
  labels, so it is the trust anchor for the scheduler's reward, the classifier's
  training data, and all reports (D10). Generalizing the harness lets one engine
  serve multiple vulnerability classes; until then only blind SQLi is covered.
- Risk (level; mitigation): high — a wrong oracle silently corrupts every label
  and every learned model downstream. Mitigated by: differential (not absolute)
  timing, median-of-repeats, decoupling detection from the payload label (removes
  the earlier circular-labeling bug), grey-box confirmation when available,
  measured oracle precision, and state reset between iterations. Safety mitigated
  by the required `--authorized` flag, default-off destructive classes, and
  auth-endpoint exclusion.
- Deliverables:
  - [x] Time-based blind SQLi detection, median of repeats — done.
  - [x] `--authorized` gate; missing-`requests` import guard — done.
  - [x] Detection decoupled from payload label (circular-labeling fix) — done.
  - [x] Labeled CSV output — done.
  - [ ] Generalize to `template + injection_point + payload_source + oracle` — todo (Phase 2).
  - [ ] Standalone deterministic oracle (differential timing + error signatures) — todo (Phase 2).
  - [ ] Grey-box coverage / DB-fault confirmation — todo (Phase 3).
  - [ ] Write `attempt`/`finding` to the shared store — todo (Phase 0 T0.8).
- Effectiveness (assessed or pending): effective for time-based blind SQLi on the
  lab (confirms known points; circular-labeling defect removed). Multi-class
  harness, standalone oracle, and grey-box confirmation pending.
