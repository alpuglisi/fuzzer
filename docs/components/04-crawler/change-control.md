# Crawler / Spider — Change Control Log

Component code: **CRAWL**. Entry format and required fields: see `../README.md`.
Newest first.

### CC-CRAWL-0003 — Consolidates into the unified store (2026-09-21)
- Change: added `--store PATH` to the crawler; after a crawl it consolidates its
  native `discovered_pages` output into the unified store via
  `fuzzlab/tools/store_adapter.import_spider`, writing `page`, `endpoint`, and
  `parameter` rows (URLs normalized to path form; query params captured). Native
  standalone output is unchanged when `--store` is omitted. Phase 0 T0.8.
- Impact (other components / project): the crawler now feeds the integration bus
  (D5); its pages/params are readable by the auditor, harness, and (later) ranker.
  Adapter-based for now; a future phase can make the crawl write directly.
- Risk (level; mitigation): low — opt-in and additive; covered by the
  consolidation end-to-end test (synthetic spider DB → page/endpoint/parameter).
- Deliverables:
  - [x] `--store` + `import_spider` (page/endpoint/parameter) (T0.8) — done.
  - [ ] Direct-to-store writes (drop the native DB) — todo (later).
- Effectiveness (assessed 2026-09-21): effective — a synthetic crawl of 5 pages
  populates 5 pages and 4 parameters in the unified store (test green).

### CC-CRAWL-0002 — Moved into the `fuzzlab` package (2026-09-21)
- Change: `spider.py` moved to `fuzzlab/tools/spider.py` and now imports `core/`
  (`get_logger`), emitting a structured startup line. Still writes its own SQLite
  file for now (T0.8 migrates it to the shared store). Part of Phase 0 T0.1.
- Impact (other components / project): the crawler is now a package module
  (`python -m fuzzlab.tools.spider`) importing the shared library; no behavior or
  output-format change yet.
- Risk (level; mitigation): low — a move plus one import; verified the module
  imports and `--help` runs.
- Deliverables:
  - [x] Move into package; import `core/` (T0.1) — done.
  - [ ] Write to the shared store (T0.8) — todo.
- Effectiveness (assessed 2026-09-21): effective — imports cleanly and runs as a
  package module.

### CC-CRAWL-0001 — Baseline (2026-09-21)
- Change: record the component at its current state — `spider.py` renders
  JavaScript via Playwright, captures fetch/XHR endpoints, resets/reuses its own
  SQLite results, and fixes the earlier port-scope bug. Standalone; not yet on the
  shared store or session manager.
- Impact (other components / project): feeds the auditor and fuzzer; currently
  writes its own database rather than the shared store, and crawls unauthenticated.
- Risk (level; mitigation): low. Present gaps (no shared store, no auth, no
  template dedup) are addressed in Phase 0 (store migration) and Phase 2
  (hardening); no current risk to other components beyond its own DB format.
- Deliverables:
  - [x] JavaScript rendering + XHR capture — done.
  - [x] Reset-by-default and `--resume`; port-scope fix — done.
  - [ ] Migrate to the shared store — todo (Phase 0 T0.8).
  - [ ] Session-manager integration + per-identity crawl — todo (Phase 1).
  - [ ] Template dedup, hybrid crawl, state-machine — todo (Phase 2).
- Effectiveness (assessed or pending): effective for JS discovery — verified that
  the Playwright engine finds all 10 JS pages the static engine missed. Remaining
  items pending.
