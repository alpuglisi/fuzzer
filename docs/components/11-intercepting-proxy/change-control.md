# Intercepting Proxy — Change Control Log

Component code: **PROXY**. Entry format and required fields: see `../README.md`.
Newest first.

### CC-PROXY-0002 — Planned: manual-login session capture (spec) (2026-09-21)
- Change: added FR-PROXY-9 — capture the authenticated session (cookies/tokens)
  from a **manual browser login** performed through the proxy and hand it to the
  session manager to adopt (FR-SESS-11). This is the escape hatch for logins the
  session manager's detection can't parse (MFA, CAPTCHA, multi-step, exotic SPA),
  with no per-host config. Spec only — no code (proxy is Phase 6).
- Impact (other components / project): gives the session manager (component #3) a
  way to stay authenticated on hosts detection can't handle; recorded in D13 and
  the Phase 6 roadmap; `ARCHITECTURE.md` #11 updated. No change to the store
  contract beyond the flows the proxy already records.
- Risk (level; mitigation): low (planning). Captured secrets are sensitive;
  mitigated by the proxy's existing redaction-on-write and lab-only/scope rules
  (NFR-PROXY-safe) and by not persisting them in cleartext.
- Deliverables:
  - [x] FR-PROXY-9 recorded — done.
  - [ ] Implement session capture + handoff to the session manager — todo (Phase 6).
- Effectiveness (assessed or pending): pending — built in Phase 6.

### CC-PROXY-0001 — Baseline (2026-09-21)
- Change: specify the component (requirements written). Not yet implemented.
  Decision D4 sets the build-from-scratch hybrid (sans-I/O parsed path + raw byte
  path); decision D5 fixes it as an optional observer on the shared store.
- Impact (other components / project): once built, it writes `flow` rows the
  anomaly detector, UI, and analysis read; it attaches the session manager as an
  addon so manual traffic is authenticated. Because it is optional (D5), no other
  component gains a hard dependency on it, and timing-sensitive fuzzing must be
  able to bypass it. Adds `flow` (+ raw bytes) to the store contract.
- Risk (level; mitigation): medium — a proxy in the data path can distort timing
  and is a security-sensitive component (TLS MITM, stored raw traffic). Mitigated
  by keeping it optional and out of the timing path (D5), a local-only CA, scope
  enforcement, redaction on write, and batched non-blocking history. The raw path
  isolates byte-exact study from the parsed path.
- Risk justification (accepted): building from scratch instead of adopting
  mitmproxy is accepted for the flexibility it buys (D4) — the byte-exact raw path
  and full control over interception — at the cost of more implementation work,
  sequenced after the session manager (Phase 6).
- Deliverables:
  - [ ] Async core; parsed (`h11`/`h2`/`wsproto`) + raw byte paths — todo (Phase 6).
  - [ ] CONNECT + TLS interception (local CA, cached leaf certs) — todo (Phase 6).
  - [ ] History: `flow` rows, FTS5, batched writes, content-addressed bodies — todo (Phase 6).
  - [ ] Repeater (DB-persisted tabs) + match-and-replace + scope engine — todo (Phase 6).
  - [ ] Interception-as-awaited-future workflow — todo (Phase 6).
  - [ ] Session-manager addon integration — todo (Phase 6).
- Effectiveness (assessed or pending): pending — not yet built. Will be judged by
  byte-exact replay, searchable shared history, and zero impact on timing-sensitive
  runs (which bypass it).
