# core/ Shared Library — Change Control Log

Component code: **CORE**. Entry format and required fields: see `../README.md`.
Newest first.

### CC-CORE-0001 — Baseline (2026-09-21)
- Change: specify the component (requirements written). Not yet implemented; the
  existing tools currently carry their own ad-hoc storage and helpers.
- Impact (other components / project): once built, every tool depends on it; it
  establishes the store as the integration bus (D5) and removes duplicated
  storage/logging/HTTP logic from the tools (D6). Until then, tools remain
  loosely coupled through separate SQLite files.
- Risk (level; mitigation): medium — this is the most depended-on component, so a
  bad schema or API is expensive to change later. Mitigated by numbered
  migrations, a versioned feature store, and building it first (Phase 0) before
  much depends on it.
- Deliverables:
  - [ ] Package layout with `core/` — todo (Phase 0 T0.1).
  - [ ] Store + migrations — todo (Phase 0 T0.3).
  - [ ] Config, logging, budget+mutex, HTTP seam — todo (Phase 0 T0.4).
  - [ ] Versioned features + golden tests — todo (Phase 0 T0.5).
- Effectiveness (assessed or pending): pending — not yet built.
