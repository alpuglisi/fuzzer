# core/ Shared Library — Requirement Specification

Component code: **CORE** · Status: `[planned]` (Phase 0) · Last updated: 2026-09-21

Related: `ARCHITECTURE.md` #2; `DECISIONS_AND_ROADMAP.md` (D5, D6); the store
contract; `./change-control.md`.

## 1. Purpose
Provide the shared foundation every tool imports: the project store, config,
logging, the request budget, feature extraction, an HTTP send seam, and the
plugin registry. It is the layer that makes the store the integration bus.

## 2. Scope
- **In:** store access and migrations; config; logging; budget and concurrency;
  versioned features; HTTP send seam; plugin registry.
- **Out:** any tool-specific logic; network protocols beyond a basic send seam
  (the proxy owns those).

## 3. Functional requirements
- **FR-CORE-1** Manage a single SQLite project store: schema, PRAGMAs (WAL,
  `synchronous=NORMAL`, `busy_timeout`, foreign keys), content-addressed bodies,
  and a numbered, forward-only migration runner.
- **FR-CORE-2** Provide versioned feature extraction (`extract_vN`) writing
  `features_json` + `feature_version`.
- **FR-CORE-3** Provide layered config (defaults → file → env → CLI), validated,
  and hashed onto the `run` row.
- **FR-CORE-4** Provide structured logging carrying `run_id`, `tool`, `identity`,
  and `flow_id` where applicable, plus an audit log of every request.
- **FR-CORE-5** Provide a request-budget manager with per-component caps and a
  per-host mutex that serializes timing-sensitive traffic to concurrency 1.
- **FR-CORE-6** Provide an HTTP send helper that requires a session context and
  records raw bytes.
- **FR-CORE-7** Provide a plugin registry (entry points plus hooks).

## 4. Non-functional requirements
- **NFR-CORE-single-writer** All store writes go through one writer path; readers
  never block the writer (WAL).
- **NFR-CORE-deterministic** Feature extraction is a pure function of
  (request, response, baseline); recomputable over history.
- **NFR-CORE-secrets** Secrets are referenced, never stored in the store or
  config; redaction on write.
- **NFR-CORE-no-bypass** No tool constructs HTTP or session state outside core.

## 5. Interfaces and data contracts
Owns the store schema and migrations. Writes `run`, `schema_version`,
`request_budget`, `model`. Exposes Python APIs consumed by every tool and ML
component.

## 6. Dependencies (components)
None (foundational layer; it manages the project store).

## 7. Acceptance criteria
- A fresh database is created by the migration runner; re-running is idempotent.
- A run records its config hash; budget checkouts and the timing mutex are
  enforced.
- Golden-file feature tests pass; a feature change bumps `feature_version`.

## 8. Open questions
- Package name.
- Per-project database files plus a small global config database, versus one
  global database.
