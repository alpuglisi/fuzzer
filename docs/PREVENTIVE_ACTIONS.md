# Preventive actions

The active rules to follow while working on this project. Each is a preventive
action from a bug investigation (`docs/bugs/`). No background here by design —
read this list and follow it. Consult it before and during changes.

Format: `PA-NNNN — <rule>. (from BUG-NNNN)`

- **PA-0001** — In tests, do not hardcode a value that a source-of-truth constant
  or registry in the code already defines (schema head version, `FEATURE_VERSION`,
  enum members, etc.); derive the expectation from that source. Reserve literal
  expected values for genuinely fixed external contracts. (from BUG-0001)
- **PA-0002** — When a bug investigation adds a preventive action, sweep the whole
  codebase for existing instances of that bug class and remediate them (or record
  why not) — do not fix only the instance that triggered the investigation. (from
  BUG-0002)
- **PA-0003** — A storage or serialization convention that must hold across more
  than one writer lives in exactly one shared function that every writer calls at
  the write site — not as a per-writer private helper, and not as a convention
  stated only in prose. New writers of the same column/field go through that shared
  function (e.g. result URLs are stored in path form via `fuzzlab.core.urls.to_path`).
  (from BUG-0003)
- **PA-0004** — A committed default that selects an external identity, credential, or
  endpoint must be a value the target actually accepts **and** must match what the lab
  provisions (compose / `.env` / schema) — not a developer's local assumption. And
  when an incident is resolved only by an environment workaround (an `ERROR_LOG` entry
  marked `Environment`), still fix the repo default that caused it, so a fresh checkout
  does not reproduce it. (from BUG-0004)
- **PA-0005** — Every library imported at runtime — including one pulled in by a
  third-party backend the code instantiates — must be a **declared** dependency; never
  assume a different installed library satisfies another's requirement (e.g.
  `cryptography` does not provide PyCrypto's `Crypto`). And a real code path that test
  doubles bypass everywhere must still have at least one test exercising the real
  implementation (skippable when it needs an environment feature) or a documented
  on-host smoke check, so fresh-install / first-use failures are caught before a user
  hits them. (from BUG-0005)
